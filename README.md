# Smart Stock Decision Assistant
This project aims to build a comprehensive stock prediction assistant by integrating machine learning, news sentiment analysis, and stock technical indicators. It addresses the gap in traditional trading systems that either ignore real-time news or fail to quantify investor sentiment.
In the modern financial landscape, data is abundant but often underutilized. Traders and investors face difficulties in combining various data sources—particularly unstructured data such as news headlines and structured data like price indicators. Machine learning can learn patterns in technical indicators, while NLP-based sentiment analysis decodes market sentiment. This project synthesizes these capabilities into one system. The primary motivation is to empower users—even non-experts—with an AI-driven decision support tool that is adaptive, fast, and interpretable.
